title: A Workbook for Crafting Digital History 
---

This workbook supports #HIST39070 in the Winter 2016 term at Carleton University. The main course materials are in the Github repo; where the information in this book and on the repo diverge, the repo will be taken as the 'correct' version.

I provided this book so that students could have a copy of all of the written course materials in one place, in the format of their choosing - pdf, html, epub, etc.

_Caveat Lector_ I haven't gone through and changed all the links yet, nor have I created the updated repository. The [Winter 2015 version is here.](https://github.com/hist3907b-winter2015)

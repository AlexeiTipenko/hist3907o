# Conclusion

There will be a profound and witty concluding paragraph here, some day. But if you've noticed anything at all, it's that the process of crafting digital history never comes to an end. [Adam Crymble](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000206/000206.html) published a piece recently that throws this into high relief - pay attention to his second paragraph in his main diagram!

In the meantime, I do want you to know that you too can craft excellent digital history. There were some great moments in that first iteration, and you will have great moments too: like when Matt forked one of my tutorials and rewrote it for the better, or built a virtual machine. Or when Patrick finally slayed Github! Or when Allison got the Canadiana API to work. Or when Phoebe finally persuaded Inkscape to play nice. Or when Matt conquered TWARC. Or when TEI blew Ryan's mind. Or when Christina forked an Anthropology class project at MSU to repurpose for her project. Or... or... or. We covered a lot of ground.
